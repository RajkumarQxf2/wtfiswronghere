This is a simple code using the for loop with range and to print the numbers from 1 to 99 which are divisible by 3, 5, 3 & 5 and calling the name fizz, buzz and fizzbuss respectively.
There was no error but the range it took was from 1 to 99 which actually excludes the number 99.
So Updated line 34 from fizzbuzz(99) to fizzbuzz(100)
