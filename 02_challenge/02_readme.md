This is a simple code using the for loop with range to print the numbers from 1 to 99 which are divisible by 3, 5, 3 & 5 and calling the name fizz, buzz and fizzbuss respectively.
The error was in line 26 where the methode was initialised with and parameter and when calling the methode the argument was not sent.
Updated line 26 replacing fizzbuzz() to fizzbuzz(100)
