This is a simple code using the for loop with range and using import file (conf) to read num1 and num2 from the file and to print the numbers from 1 to 99 which are divisible by 3, 5, 3 & 5 and calling the name fizz, buzz and fizzbuss respectively.
There was in error in Step 21.
Updated line 21 from num2 = conf.num to num2 = conf.num2
