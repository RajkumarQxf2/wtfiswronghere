This is a simple code using the for loop with range and using import file (fizzbuzz) to call methode from the file and to print the numbers from 1 to 99 which are divisible by 3, 5, 3 & 5 and calling the name fizz, buzz and fizzbuss respectively.
There was in error when importing and calling the method. Both the importing file and calling method had the same name which gives little confusion.
Updated line 11 from import fizzbuzz to from fizzbuzz import fizzbuzz.
