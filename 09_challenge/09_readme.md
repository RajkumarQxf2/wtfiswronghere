This is a simple code using the for loop with range to print the numbers from 1 to 99 which are divisible by 3, 5, 3 & 5 and calling the name fizz, buzz and fizzbuss respectively.
There was no error but the i range was from 6 to 99.
Updated line 23 from for i in range(6,max_num): to for i in range(1,max_num):
