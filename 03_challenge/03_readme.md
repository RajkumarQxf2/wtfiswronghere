This is a simple code using the for loop with range to print the numbers from 1 to 99 which are divisible by 3, 5, 3 & 5 and calling the name fizz, buzz and fizzbuss respectively.
The error was in line 26 where the methode was expecting an interger num and the passed parameter was '16' which was a string.
Updated line 26 replacing '16' to 100
