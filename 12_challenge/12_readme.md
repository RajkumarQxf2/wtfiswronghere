This is a simple code using the for loop with range and Class & Object to print the numbers from 1 to 99 which are divisible by 3, 5, 3 & 5 and calling the name fizz, buzz and fizzbuss respectively.
There was no syntax error but the num 2 was declared as 4 instead of 5.
Updated Step 18 from self.num2 = 4 to self.num2 = 5.
